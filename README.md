# Restaurant Recommendations
## Ryan Chan

This is a very rough exploratory project. It is in the form of a Jupyter Python notebook, Project.ipynb. It is not clean and contains some extraneous parts.

Requires seperate downloading of the Yelp Dataset, found at https://www.yelp.com/dataset. Download and extract files to the `yelp_dataset` directory.

Also attached is a pdf version of an already exectured notebook, in case you aren't interested in running it yourself. See ProjectOutput.pdf.

### Requirements:
* python3 >= 3.7
* numpy
* pandas
* sklearn
* pymilvus
* A Milvus server running somewhere
